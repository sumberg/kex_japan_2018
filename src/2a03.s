;;; Return:	r24: number of Atmega clock cycles per 6502 clock cycle
;;;
;;; When this function is run, the 6502 is being fed the STA instruction with
;;; absolute addressing, which takes four cycles. At its fourth cycle, it pulls
;;; the R/W line down. This can be used to measure how many clock cycles the
;;; Atmega has done for each cycle the 6502 has done by counting how many cycles
;;; it takes between each time R/W transitions from low to high. In this
;;; function the numer of Atmega cycles is counted for two such transitions to
;;; ensure that the timer is started and stopped at the exact same phase of the
;;; R/W transition. The counted number of cycles is divided by 8 to get the
;;; number of Atmega cycles per one 6502 cycle.
