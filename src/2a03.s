;;; Parameters:
;;;		r24: Address high byte
;;; 	r22: Address low byte
;;;		r20: Value
;;; Return:	none
;;;
;;; Puts a given value at a given memory address by writing the following
;;; instructions:
;;;
;;; LDA #<val>
;;; STA <address high> <address low>
;;;
;;; The write is followed by an STA_zp to keep the 6502 running.
