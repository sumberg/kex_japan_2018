# Planning

We had to decide on how the system should look like on a hardware level, and decided to set up some requirements for the system, in order to decide what parts would be needed. We also set up some requirements for how to eliminate hardware that was not to be considered, i.e. too difficult implementation, bad I/O-options considering communication with RP2A03 and other peripherals etc. [l√§s tracker_features.md]

Planning was done during the few laboratory visits in November and December, together with supervisor Negishi.
