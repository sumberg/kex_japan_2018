   abstract = {Research methods and methodologies are extremelyimportant when conducting research and degree projects. Theuse and application of the methods and methodologies areconsidered to be “necessarily vicious” and, unfortunately,often applied after the research has been conducted. The needfor applying methods before the actually research and thereasons for doing so are often stressed in the literature andcourses for research and scientific writing. This includes theaspects of selecting, understanding and applying researchmethods for a selected project. Unfortunately, it is difficult tochoose well-suited methods and too often the selected methodsand methodologies do not match each other. Instead, methodsare applied without knowing about the consequences theapplied method have both on the other chosen methods and onthe results of the work or research. This paper provides aportal of research methods and methodologies to help thestudents to choose and apply the most suitable methods byillustrating which methods belong together and thedistinctions between the different methods. },
