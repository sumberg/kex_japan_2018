## Elias:
* Line 13
  - Char 101: In "The use of information systems...", it could create a bigger contrast between the two mentioned examples if the words 'large' and 'small' were squeezed in. Or not, maybe I'm too detailed hehe.
    - "The use of information systems can range from _large_ data storage, analysis and organization, to communication systems such as smaller mail servers."
* Line 17:
  - The word 'risk' is used twice in the first sentence, is there any other word that could be used to replace one 'risk'?
* Line 28:
  - Before mentioning the NESizer2 method it might be good to first mention/partially present it somewhere in the problem/background part, and not only in the title.
  - Char 258: Aswell as -> as well as (?)
* Line 30:
  - Really well put together paragraph!
  - Char 44: Some insight to -> Some insight into (?)
  - Char 235: Very -> quite (?)
* Line 34:
  - Char 242: Their -> its (?)
* Line 73:
  - The word 'realized' was used in the previous paragraph (line 71, char 248). Maybe swap one of them to the phrase 'came to the conclusion' or something similar?
* Line 77:
  - Char 105: Almost -> An almost (since the following word 'instant popularity' contains a noun?)
