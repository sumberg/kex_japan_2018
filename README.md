### Comparison of methods for controlling legacy hardware from a modern micro-controller

**Abstract**  
The usage of computers for creating music has existed since the early days of personal computers, and has in recent years gathered a community of people using these “retro” computer systems and their sound chips to create and perform “chiptune” music. These computers each has unique and characteristic sound qualities that stems from the hardware implementation used in them, and while this hardware could be emulated in a modern computer it is often considered “high status” in the chiptune scene to use the actual hardware to compose and perform music.  
An issue might be that any software for composing music on these retro machines will have to be made with the restrictions and limitations of that machine as well. If possible, it would be preferred to write software on a modern system that could allow for more complexity, while also controlling the old hardware to utilize its desired qualities.  

This problem does not only apply to the specific case mentioned above. Consider any legacy system that one day will require and upgrade, but where emulation of the old system is not an option - how can you control legacy hardware from a modern system, and what would be an efficient implementation?
